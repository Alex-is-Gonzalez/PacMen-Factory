## Description
Two buttons were created to code the PacMen Factory. The "Add PacMan" button positions the PacMan image on the screen which is stored in the update function. When the "Move PacMan" button is clicked, PacMen are added to an array which will keep track of the position and velocity of each PacMan within the move function. This code exemplifies the ability to bounce images of PacMen off the walls due to wall detection.  
## Installation 
Download a copy of the PacMen Factory repo. Drag and drop PacMan.Html onto a blank webpage and load the page. You should see an empty PacMen Factory. Press the buttons to create and move the factory.

## Usage
This project highlights working with the DOM, arrays, conditional statements, and call back functions.

## Roadmap
A goal for this project is to have PacMan's image change direction based on it's trajectory of impact. A conditional function will be added that will flip the images. 
A second goal is to make the PacMan's mouth open and close as it moves througout the page.
